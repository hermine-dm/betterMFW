	<title>Better Motherfucking Website</title>

</head>
<body>
	<header>
		<h1> This is <em> still </em> a motherfucking website. </h1> 
		And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.
	</header>

		<h2> Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit. </h2>

		<h3><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong> </h3>

		<p> That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Shit's <em> still </em> lightweight and loads fast </li>
			<li> <em> Still </em> fits on all your shitty screens </li>
			<li> <em> Still </em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers </li>
			<li> The motherfucker's <em> still </em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site </li>
			<li> Shit's <em> still </em> legible and gets your fucking point across </li>
					</ul>

		<h3> and guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
		<p>	You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
	

		<h2> Let it breathe </h2>

		<p> Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off. </p>

		<p> If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

		<h2> A little less contrast </h2>
		<p> Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines..</p>

		<h2> Size Matters </h2>
		<p> I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen. </p>


		<h2> Line-width, motherfucker </h2>
		<p> Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

		<h3> Yes, this is <em> also </em> fucking satire, you fuck </h3>

		<p>  I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
